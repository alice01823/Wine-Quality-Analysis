# Wine-Quality-Analysis

### Project Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis for a project focused on analyzing the quality of wine based on various physicochemical properties. The project aims to understand the factors that influence wine quality and develop predictive models to classify wine quality ratings.

### Key Features:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Examining the distribution and relationships of the physicochemical properties with wine quality ratings.
- Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, transforming, and scaling the data to prepare it for modeling.
- Feature Engineering: Creating new features or transforming existing ones to capture important information for predicting wine quality.
- Predictive Modeling: Building machine learning models, such as classification algorithms, to predict wine quality ratings based on the physicochemical properties.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization: Creating visualizations to illustrate the relationships between features and wine quality, as well as the performance of the predictive models.

Project Structure:
- Jupyter Notebooks: Contains Python code for data analysis, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
- Data Files: Includes datasets used for analysis and modeling.
- Documentation: Supplementary materials such as project documentation, reports, and presentations.
